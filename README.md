# blank_typewriter
A repository of the blank project for Uncommon Hacks 2018. The project is a Heroku hosted app that takes in input fron a type writer via a javascript Heroku app, sends that data to a python Heroku app, and has your phone speak based upon the commands specified in typewriter_commands.txt. An app by Michael Sitver and Gregory Howlett-Gomez.
